## Recently added 
- pulse microstructure

## <font color='green'>TODO</font>
- priority
  
  - add support for 2 and 4 bit filterbanks
  - allow injection into dedispersed timeseries
  - write more useful output logs during injection
  - more intuitive SNR input / correct SNR calculation for custom pulse profiles
  - frequency dependence for scattering / fix scattering_time units

- nonpriority
  - add $\dot{\omega}$, $\dot{P_b}$, etc.
  - add more binary models to python mode (DD, DDGR, etc.) / allow pint mode to use any binary model
  - scintillation
  - single pulse
  - DMX
  - PMRA, PMDEC and parallax
  - add mask to injected signal in time/frequency
 
Let me know if you would like any other features, or if you want to move a nonpriority feature into priority.
