## Recently added 
- intra-channel DM smearing
- custom PSD
- more robust SNR estimation for custom profiles
- frequency dependent scattering

## <font color='green'>TODO</font>
- priority
  - allow injection into dedispersed timeseries
  - write more useful output logs during injection

- nonpriority
  - add $\dot{\omega}$, $\dot{P_b}$, etc.
  - add more binary models to python mode (DD, DDGR, etc.) / allow pint mode to use any binary model
  - scintillation
  - single pulse
  - DMX
  - PMRA, PMDEC and parallax
  - add mask to injected signal in time/frequency
 
Let me know if you would like any other features, or if you want to move a nonpriority feature into priority.
